init_desktop.rs is a simple rust program intended to init my desktop using the [dotfiles I made](https://github.com/Lunarequest/Dotfiles). init_desktop.rs is extreamly fast and installs all the dotfiles and dependencies in 5~10 minutes depending on your internet speed and how many of the deps you preinstall.

The dependancies on the host system that are required are as follows:
- zsh
- neovim
- vim
- git/libgit2
- stow
- curl
